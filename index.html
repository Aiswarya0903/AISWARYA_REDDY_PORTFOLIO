								<h2 class="alt"> <strong>Hello!</strong></h2>
								<p>I am Aiswarya, a data analyst and quality specialist passionate about working with organizations and communities in evaluating data acquisition methods. My specialization includes refining datasets, implementing statistical methodologies, using visual representation techniques and efficient data fitting models with distinct strategies for research findings. The objective is to provide evidence-based insights that help decision-making based on factual information. After having worked for renowned company Amazon as Quality Specialist, I wanted to explore the field of Data Analytics and Business Analytics. Now, I am pursuing my Masters at University of South Florida in 'Business Analytics and Information Systems'.</p>

								<h2>Projects</h2>
							</header>

							<p>I have worked as a data analyst on projects in a variety of industries, such as health, e-commerce, human resources, and airlines. Each project benefited from my technical expertise in data cleaning, data visualization, statistical modeling, and machine learning. I am knowledgeable on SQL database management systems, data visualization software like Tableau and Power BI, and the Python and R programming languages. These projects serve as examples of my capacity to manage huge datasets and produce useful insights.</p>

											<h2><strong>Prediction of occurrence of Brain Stroke</strong></h2>
											<p>Skills used are Python, Weka, and Azure ML Studio. </p>
											<p>Link for the project : https://github.com/Aiswarya0903/-Prediction-of-occurrence-of-Brain-Stroke</p>
											<p>The occurrence of Brain stroke is predicted by extracting data, structuring it, and choosing which model best fits the data to give better results. 

On standardized data, algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks were developed and used to predict the presence of Brain Stroke in patients. The models were evaluated and adjusted to get the best Recall score.

I chose this project to get a brief hindsight on how analytics could be used in the health sector. As health analytics are very crucial as they deal with the lives of people, the Accuracy and Recall score plays an important role here. </p>

Prediction of Employee Absenteeism at work

Skills used are Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SKLEARN and Keras)</p>
<p>Link for the project : https://github.com/Aiswarya0903/-Prediction-of-Employee-Absenteeism-at-work</p>
<p>The Employee's Absence at Work is predicted by considering data from July 2007 to July 2010 at a courier company in Brazil.

Distinct machine learning models Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision trees, and Deep Neural Networks are created for the best performance analysis in Python to get the best accuracy score.

This project gives insights into Human Resources(HR) Analytics where the employee's absence can be validated using various reasons which can potentially impact the weightage for the decision-making process for promotion and termination of an employee at the organization.</p>

											<h2>Analyzing-Investments-and-Property-Values-of-St.-Petersburg</h2>
											<p>Skills : Tableau, analytical skills</p>
											<p>Link for the project : https://github.com/Aiswarya0903/Analyzing-Investments-and-Property-Values-of-St.-Petersburg</p>
											<p>The aim of the project involves the analysis of non-school district taxable property values on commercial corridors in the CRA of St. Petersburg, FL since 2018 with a focus on understanding annual changes and overall trends. The analysis depicts the insights into how these values of all corridors changed over the designated period of time, helping anyone intending on building, rent, purchasing, or investing in property located in St. Petersburg. The project’s goal is to examine the efficiency of the city of St. Petersburg’s investments (both public and private) in various corridors of interest and to learn which investments have been the most successful so that the city might make similar investments in the future. • Conducted analysis of non-school district taxable property values on commercial corridors in the CRA Developed interactive visualization to rank commercial corridors in non-school taxable district. • Provided valuable that enable stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding investments and further developments in the commercial corridors. • Demonstrated expertise in data analysis, visualization, and providing valuable insights to stakeholders.</p>
