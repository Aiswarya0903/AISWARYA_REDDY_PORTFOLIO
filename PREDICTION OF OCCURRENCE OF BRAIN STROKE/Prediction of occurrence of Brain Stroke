# Prediction of occurrence of Brain Stroke

## Skills used are Python, Weka, and Azure ML Studio.

The occurrence of Brain stroke is predicted by extracting data, structuring it, and choosing which model best fits the data to give better results. 

On standardized data, algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks were developed and used to predict the presence of Brain Stroke in patients. The models were evaluated and adjusted to get the best Recall score.

I chose this project to get a brief hindsight on how analytics could be used in the health sector. As health analytics are very crucial as they deal with the lives of people, the Accuracy and Recall score plays an important role here.
